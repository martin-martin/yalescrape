Brilliance All Around is the theme of this year’s Staff Appreciation Day on June 14 (RSVP). It speaks to the great work that Yale’s staff members do each and every day to support Yale’s mission. Shine a spotlight on your team’s endeavors by telling us about the ‘brilliant’ contributions your department makes. The names of all participants will be entered into a random prize drawing.
