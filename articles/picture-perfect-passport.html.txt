Bad photos are the #1 reason passport applications get held up during the application process. In 2015, we received more than 200,000 unacceptable passport photos! Submitting a passport application with a bad photo will delay processing your application and could interfere with planned travel.

That’s why during the month of September the U.S. Department of State is promoting the #PicturePerfectPassport campaign on our @TravelGov Twitter handle and the Bureau of Consular Affair’s Facebook page.

Save yourself the anxiety of delays and make sure you’re not making these mistakes!
