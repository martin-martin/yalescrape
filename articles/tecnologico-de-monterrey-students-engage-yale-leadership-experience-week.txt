This week a group of 30 students from the Tecnológico de Monterrey are visiting Yale to participate in Yale Leadership Experience Week. Throughout the week-long program, participants attend numerous lectures by Yale faculty and alumni on a wide variety of topics ranging from emotional intelligence to international affairs. They tour various Yale schools, museums, and galleries, and engage with other Yale students, faculty, and alumni in a variety of social activities.

Yale has a growing relationship with the Tecnológico de Monterrey, which began in 2005 with the Tec Summer Program at Yale University. The relationship further expanded when Open Yale Courses were added to Tec’s Knowledge Hub, as well as through collaborations on Yale Week in Mexico, Bulldogs in Monterrey internship program, and ongoing participation by Tec in the Yale Visitor International Student Program. Tec is one of the largest and most well-respected educational institutions in Mexico.
