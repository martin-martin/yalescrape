Project Description

The Yale Center for British Art, an iconic modern building in New Haven, Connecticut, designed by the American architect Louis I. Kahn to house Paul Mellon’s extraordinary gift to Yale University, reopened to the public on May 11, 2016, after the completion of the third phase of a multi-year building conservation project.

Led by Knight Architecture, LLC, this was the most complex building conservation work undertaken at the Center to date, comprising the entire structure, from roof to basement. It renewed the Center’s public galleries, internal systems, spaces, and amenities, and provided an opportunity to reimagine and reinstall the Center’s renowned collections of more than five centuries of British art.

Project History

After more than a decade of research on the history of the design and construction of Kahn’s final building, the reopening of the Center marked the completion of a three-phase renovation plan. The first phase of work included the rehabilitation of the Center’s exterior Lower Court (2008–2011) and extensive repairs to the adjacent Lecture Hall lobby (2011–2013). This was followed by two additional phases addressing the building’s interior spaces: the second phase focused on refurbishing the areas used by the departments of Prints & Drawings and Rare Books & Manuscripts (2013); the third phase included enhancing the Center’s public spaces (namely the galleries and Lecture Hall), extensive building-wide mechanical and electrical upgrades, and improvements to fire protection, security systems, and accessibility (2015–2016).
