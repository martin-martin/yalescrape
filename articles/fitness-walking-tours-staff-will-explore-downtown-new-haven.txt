Staff members will have the opportunity to mingle exercise with urban exploration this summer, thanks to The Shops at Yale.

The retail and restaurant group is sponsoring 10 fitness walking tours, led by Shana Schneider, a physical education instructor at Payne Whitney Gymnasium and founder of Fitstyle by Shana. Schneider will share fun facts and insider tips, and promises to take participants along a few surprising paths and walkways. She will set the pace to at least a 20-minute mile and remain on sidewalks and paved areas (the walks on July 10 and July 24 will be at a slower pace). Participants will also receive vouchers for special gifts and promotions from several local shops after the tour.

The tours will begin at noon from different locations:

Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History , 170 Whitney Ave. (Tuesday, June 12, July 10, and July 31).



, 170 Whitney Ave. (Tuesday, June 12, July 10, and July 31). Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library , 121 Wall St. (Tuesday, June 19; Thursday, July 5; and Tuesday, July 24).



, 121 Wall St. (Tuesday, June 19; Thursday, July 5; and Tuesday, July 24). Yale School of Medicine (Rotunda), 333 Cedar St. (Thursday, June 21 and June 28; Wednesday, July 18 and Aug. 8.

The tours are free for Yale staff who have not previously participated in a lunchtime Fitstyle Walking Tour. Registration — for one walk at a time — is required. A minimum of eight people must be registered 24 hours prior to the event or the walk may be rescheduled.

The walk, which will take about 45 minutes, will begin and end in the same location. Tours will leave the start location no later than 10 minutes after the start time. In the event of inclement weather, the walk will take place provided the temperature is above 32 degrees and below 90 degrees.
