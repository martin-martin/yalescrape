Flu season is here. In the United States, flu viruses are most common during the fall and winter months. In addition to getting a seasonal flu vaccine, you can take everyday preventive actions (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/habits/index.htm) like staying away from sick people and washing your hands to reduce the spread of germs. Handwashing is one of the best defenses against the spread of diseases such as colds or the flu. Contact the Yale Health Center or your primary care provider if you are feeling ill.
